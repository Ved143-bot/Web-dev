            <h2>What is Soil?</h2>
            <p>Soil is a natural resource that forms the foundation of agriculture. It is a mixture of organic matter, minerals, gases, liquids, and organisms that together support life. Healthy soil is essential for the growth of plants and is crucial for sustaining food production.</p>

            <h2>Types of Soil</h2>
            <p>There are several types of soil, each with unique characteristics that influence its suitability for different crops:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clay Soil:</strong> Heavy and nutrient-rich, but can retain too much water.</li>
                <li><strong>Sandy Soil:</strong> Drains quickly and is easy to work with but lacks nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Silt Soil:</strong> Retains moisture well and is fertile, but can be compacted easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Peaty Soil:</strong> High in organic matter and acidic, suitable for specific crops like potatoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Chalky Soil:</strong> Alkaline soil that requires careful management to support crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Loamy Soil:</strong> A balanced mixture of sand, silt, and clay, considered ideal for most crops.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Maintain Soil Health</h2>
            <p>Maintaining soil health is crucial for sustainable agriculture. Here are some tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use organic compost and natural fertilizers to enrich the soil.</li>
                <li>Practice crop rotation to prevent nutrient depletion.</li>
                <li>Implement cover cropping to reduce erosion and improve soil structure.</li>
                <li>Avoid over-irrigation to prevent waterlogging and salinization.</li>
                <li>Reduce chemical use to protect beneficial organisms in the soil.</li>
                <li>Test soil regularly to monitor its pH, nutrients, and other properties.</li>
                <li>Incorporate organic matter such as mulch to improve moisture retention.</li>
